# Generative AI API
GenAPI provides a **helper API**, ready to integrate **functions repository**, and a **quickstart cookbook** for building Generative AI Apps.

![GenAPI Functions Workflow](../assets/images/genmapp-functions-workflow.png)

Our launch recipe is using [OpenAI Functions with Climate APIs](functions/openai-functions-with-climate-apis.md) available as a Jupyter notebook. We use this notebook to illustrate a number of fundamental concepts. For example, we demonstrate how to use the helper API to simulate a chat experience within a Jupyter notebook with a simple statement. We also demonstrate with the accompanying Climate API examples how to write a function and crisp specification which can be consumed by the LLM with accuracy.
